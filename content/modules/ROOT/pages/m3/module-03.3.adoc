== Developer Activity: Developer On-Boarding Example

include::../style.adoc[]

Until now, you've been acting in the role of a platform engineer. Let's switch persona to that of a developer: `dev1`. 

Let's assume that this developer needs to create a development environment to work on a new feature - we can use a Software Template to assist with this task. A prerequisite to using this template is that the developer has a Quay account, so their code can be built into a container image and pushed to an image registry for storage and scanning. 

While OpenShift has a built-in image registry, there are various reasons we're using Quay as our image registry:

* Security scanning for container images via Clair.
* Support for image signing and trust policies.
* Vulnerability detection with detailed reports.
* RBAC and repository/organisation permissions.
* Better suited for multi-tenant and multi-cluster environments.


IMPORTANT: Please make sure to log in to {product_name_rhdh} as a *Developer* with *dev1/{common_password}* as described in the next step to avoid errors.

=== Create an Account in Quay

You'll need an account in Quay to push your developer's container images for scanning and deployment.

. Visit the https://quay.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Quay Registry^, window="quay"] deployed in your workshop environment.
. Click the *Create Account* link.
