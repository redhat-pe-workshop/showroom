. Click the *Choose* button on the *Quarkus Service*. The *Software Templates* screen will be displayed.
. In Step 1, you'll be prompted to enter a set of application parameters. Thankfully, defaults are provided by the template, so you can simply click *Next*.
. In Step 2, when prompted to *Provide Image Registry Information*:
  * Select the *Quay* image registry.
  * Enter your Quay password: `{common_password}`
  * Click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Your username is automatically determined by the Template using your current session.
