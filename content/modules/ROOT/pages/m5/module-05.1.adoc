include::../style.adoc[]


. Navigate to the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store-my-feature-branch[feature-branch component, window="rhdh"] you had created. If prompted, login as dev1/{common_password}.

. Click on the *View Source* link to access the git repo of this component.
. Navigate to the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/merge_requests[Merge Requests page^, window="gitlab"]. Initiate a merge request by clicking on the *New merge request* button.

. Since this merge request is to the `parasol-store` component, the `parasol-store-build-pr-open` pipeline gets triggered and can be viewed in the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/ci[`parasol-store` component, window="rhdh"].

* Once the pipeline completes, make note of the final task `gitlab-update-task`, which updates GitLab's Merge Request with the status of the pipeline.
+

* This status update can be visible in GitLab's Merge Request page. Note that the Pipeline is marked as _Passed_ and ready to be merged.
+

* This handoff between the Tekton pipelines and GitLab is through the use of webhooks. 
* From {product_name_rhdh}, click on the `gitlab-update-task` in the Tekton pipeline run.
+

* Note the POST call to GitLab. Scroll to the right of this request call, and you will note that the POST call sends `state=success` along with the Commit ID which then marks that particular Merge Request as success.
* In GitLab, navigate to https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/hooks[parasol-store's Webhooks page, window="gitlab"] to view the Webhooks which have been setup as part of this workshop.


== Developer Activity: Merge request from feature-branch to main

* In real world, the merge would happen after a peer-review, or a team-lead would review and _merge_ the PR. For the purposes of this workshop, let us go ahead and assume the role of a reviewer. 
* Navigate back to the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/merge_requests[Merge Request page, window="gitlab"] and open the request that you created earlier; click on the *Merge* button.
+

* The `Merge` action triggers another Pipeline in the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/ci[`parasol-store` component, window="rhdh"] on {product_name_rhdh}, which will update the Argo manifests with the new image tag.
+
image:m5/parasol-store-pr-merge-start.png[]

* When this Pipeline complete, it will 
** Update the Dev and Staging ArgoCD manifests (deployment YAMLs are updated with the new image tag).
** Create a PR against the Production ArgoCD manifests. 
+

=== Dev and Staging ArgoCD manifests updates
* Let us now see what happened to the Dev and Staging ArgoCD manifests updates. 
* In {product_name_rhdh}, access the CD tab of the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/cd[parasol-store component^, window="rhdh"].
+
image:m5/parasol-store-argo.png[]
* Click on the outgoing-arrow icon next to *parasol-store-dev* and *parasol-store-staging*. Login as (admin/{common_password}).
+
NOTE: This ArgoCD/OpenShift GitOps is meant only for applications, while the other Argo you have accessed thus far for configuring {product_name_rhdh} is only for the platform related ArgoCD applications

** You will note that both *dev* and *staging* are tagged by the Tekton Pipeline to the same image tag. Hover the pointer over the Last Sync comment as shown in the screenshots below. 
+
NOTE: You may need to *REFRESH* the Argo apps if you don't see the updates immediately.
** *Dev Argo*: parasol-store-dev
image:m5/parasol-store-argo-dev.png[]
** *Staging Argo*: parasol-store-staging
+
image:m5/parasol-store-argo-staging.png[]
+
NOTE: You can click on the `parasol-store` deploy highlighted to view the deployment YAML of both dev and staging, and you can verify they are both pointing to the same Quay image.


In the next section, you will complete the Production Manifests merge.
