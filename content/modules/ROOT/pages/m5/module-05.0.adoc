= Module 5: Build, Test, & Deploy (outer loop)

include::../style.adoc[]

== Overview

With the development inner-loop complete, the code running in the ephemeral environment's feature-branch namespace is now ready for deployment to Dev, Staging, and Production environments.

* Platform Engineers set up production-grade pipelines to handle merge requests from Developer.Tekton makes it really easy to build cloud-native pipelines that can be tailored to organizational needs.
* When a developer submits a merge request from the feature branch to the main branch, a peer review process ensures code quality before merging.
* Once merged, the pipeline updates manifests in the Dev and Staging environments. Additionally, it raises a pull request (PR) for the Production manifest.
* Manifest updates and Deployments to the Production environment require explicit approvals. In this case, production updates are triggered only by manually merging the PR raised by the post-merge pipeline.


== Module objectives

* To handle the outer-loop, Platform Engineer has built a production-level pipelines (pre and post merge) based on org needs via Tekton.
* When a developer creates a new merge request, the pre-merge pipeline is triggered via a GitLab webhook, initiating the image build process.
* An application owner/team member reviews and approves the merge-request.
* This approval triggers a post-merge pipeline that updates manifests in the Dev and Staging environments.
* The pipeline also generates a merge request for deploying to the Production environment.
* Once this prod merge-request is accepted, the application is deployed to production through GitOps/ArgoCD.
